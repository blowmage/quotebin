Probably not important, but from New Relic Install:
===================================================

Developer Mode is now a Rack middleware.

Developer Mode is no longer available in Rails 2.1 and earlier.
However, starting in version 2.12 you can use Developer Mode in any
Rack based framework, in addition to Rails.  To install developer mode
in a non-Rails application, just add NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode to
your middleware stack.

If you are using JRuby, we recommend using at least version 1.4 or
later because of issues with the implementation of the timeout library.

Refer to the README.md file for more information.

Please see http://github.com/newrelic/rpm/blob/master/CHANGELOG
for a complete description of the features and enhancements available
in version 3.5 of the Ruby Agent.

Regarding the Recommendation
============================

* there is no decomposition
* there is no optimized libraries loaded (LAPACK, Atlas, or even using any C)
* there is no larger-than-memory matrix management
* there IS some sparse matrix management (using hashes instead of full matrices, cutting computation and memory down by about 99%)
* there IS a bit of caching (QuoteCorpus)
